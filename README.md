# Puppeteer Demo

The legality of web scraping is still in a gray area. So I created a simple website to demonstrate how puppeteer.js can be used to scrape datas from a simple website.

# To start

Make sure you have `yarn` or `npm` installed on your computer.

1. Clone the repo using https

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krowter/puppeteer-demo.git
```

or ssh

```bash
git clone git@github.com:krowter/puppeteer-demo.git
```

#

2. `cd` into the directory and install `yarn` or `npm` packages

```bash
yarn
```

or

```bash
npm install
```

#

3. Create a `.env` file containing `PORT=` and fill it with whatever open port your computer have.

#

4. Run `node server.js` and `node puppeteer-bot.js` in separate terminals.
